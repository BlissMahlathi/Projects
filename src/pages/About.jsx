        Hi! I&apos;m Hlulani Bliss Mahlathi, a developer who loves turning ideas into real-world solutions. 
        With a background in web and mobile app development, I&apos;ve worked on diverse projects ranging from 
        dynamic websites to enterprise-level applications. My focus is on delivering impactful, 
        user-friendly solutions that align with clients&apos; goals. Whether it&apos;s front-end design, 
        back-end logic, or full-stack development, I thrive in bringing digital projects to life.<br/><br/>
        Over the years, I&apos;ve developed a deep understanding of technologies such as JavaScript, C, C#,
        React,Djongo, Express, Node.js, Python, C++, Next.js and database systems like MySQL and MongoDB. I&apos;ve worked with startups, 
        individual clients, and growing businesses, delivering custom solutions that drive growth.

        Outside of coding, I&apos;m passionate about learning new things, playing bass guitar, and enjoying 
        video games. Whether it&apos;s jamming out some tunes or exploring new strategies in my favorite 
        games, these hobbies help keep my creativity flowing.
